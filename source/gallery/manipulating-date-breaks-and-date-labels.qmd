```{python}

from plotnine import (
    ggplot,
    aes,
    geom_point,
    scale_x_datetime,
    labs,
    theme_set,
    theme_linedraw,
)
from plotnine.data import economics

from mizani.breaks import date_breaks
from mizani.formatters import date_format

theme_set(theme_linedraw())  # default theme
```

Using the `economics` dataset

```{python}
economics.head()
```

How does the saving rate vary with time?

```{python}
(
    ggplot(economics)
    + geom_point(aes("date", "psavert"))
    + labs(y="personal saving rate")
)
```

Yikes! the calculated breaks are awful, we need to intervene. We do so using the [date_breaks](https://mizani.readthedocs.io/en/stable/breaks.html#mizani.breaks.date_breaks) and
[date_format](https://mizani.readthedocs.io/en/stable/formatters.html#mizani.formatters.date_format)
functions from mizani.

Set breaks every 10 years

```{python}
(
    ggplot(economics)
    + geom_point(aes("date", "psavert"))
    + scale_x_datetime(breaks=date_breaks("10 years"))  # new
    + labs(y="personal saving rate")
)
```

That is better. Since all the breaks are at the beginning of the year, we can omit the month and day.
Using `date_format` we override the format string. For more on the options for the format string see
the [strftime behavior](https://docs.python.org/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior).

```{python}
(
    ggplot(economics)
    + geom_point(aes("date", "psavert"))
    + scale_x_datetime(
        breaks=date_breaks("10 years"), labels=date_format("%Y")
    )  # modified
    + labs(y="personal saving rate")
)
```

We can achieve the same result with a custom formating function.

```{python}
def custom_date_format1(breaks):
    """
    Function to format the date
    """
    return [x.year if x.month == 1 and x.day == 1 else "" for x in breaks]


(
    ggplot(economics)
    + geom_point(aes("date", "psavert"))
    + scale_x_datetime(  # modified
        breaks=date_breaks("10 years"), labels=custom_date_format1
    )
    + labs(y="personal saving rate")
)
```

We can use a custom formatting function to get results that are not obtainable with the `date_format` function.
For example if we have monthly breaks over a handful of years we can mix date formats as follows; specify beginning of the year and every other month. Such tricks can be used reduce overcrowding.

```{python}
from datetime import date


def custom_date_format2(breaks):
    """
    Function to format the date
    """
    res = []
    for x in breaks:
        # First day of the year
        if x.month == 1 and x.day == 1:
            fmt = "%Y"
        # Every other month
        elif x.month % 2 != 0:
            fmt = "%b"
        else:
            fmt = ""

        res.append(date.strftime(x, fmt))

    return res


(
    ggplot(economics.loc[40:60, :])  # modified
    + geom_point(aes("date", "psavert"))
    + scale_x_datetime(
        breaks=date_breaks("1 months"), labels=custom_date_format2, minor_breaks=[]
    )
    + labs(y="personal saving rate")
)
```

We removed the labels but not the breaks, leaving behind dangling ticks for the skipped months.
We can fix that by wrapping `date_breaks` around a filtering function.

```{python}
def custom_date_format3(breaks):
    """
    Function to format the date
    """
    res = []
    for x in breaks:
        # First day of the year
        if x.month == 1:
            fmt = "%Y"
        else:
            fmt = "%b"

        res.append(date.strftime(x, fmt))

    return res


def custom_date_breaks(width=None):
    """
    Create a function that calculates date breaks

    It delegates the work to `date_breaks`
    """

    def filter_func(limits):
        breaks = date_breaks(width)(limits)
        # filter
        return [x for x in breaks if x.month % 2]

    return filter_func


(
    ggplot(economics.loc[40:60, :])
    + geom_point(aes("date", "psavert"))
    + scale_x_datetime(  # modified
        breaks=custom_date_breaks("1 months"), labels=custom_date_format3
    )
    + labs(y="personal saving rate")
)
```

The breaks and labels functions are tightly coupled to give us exactly what we want.
