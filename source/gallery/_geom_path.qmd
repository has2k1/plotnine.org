```{python}
import pandas as pd

from plotnine import (
    ggplot,
    aes,
    geom_path,
    geom_line,
    labs,
    scale_color_continuous,
    element_text,
    theme,
)
from plotnine.data import economics
```


`geom_path()` connects the observations in the order in which they appear in the data, this is different from `geom_line()` which connects observations in order of the variable on the x axis.


```{python}
economics.head(10)  # notice the rows are ordered by date
```

Because the data is in date order `geom_path()` (in pint) produces the same result as `geom_line()` (in black):

```{python}
(
    ggplot(economics, aes(x="date", y="unemploy"))
    + geom_line(size=5)  # plot geom_line as the first layer
    + geom_path(
        colour="#ff69b4",  # plot a path - colour pink
        size=1,
    )
    + labs(x="date", y="unemployment (,000)")  # label x & y-axis
)
```

Plotting unemployment (scaled by population) versus savings rate shows how `geom_path()` differs from `geom_line()`. Because `geom_path()` connects the observations in the order in which they appear in the data, this line is like a "journey through time":

```{python}
(
    ggplot(economics, aes(x="unemploy/pop", y="psavert"))
    + geom_path()  # plot geom path
    + labs(x="scaled unemployment", y="saving rate")  # label x & y-axis
)
```

Comparing `geom_line()` (black) to `geom_path()` (pink) shows how these two plots differ in what they can show: `geom_path()` shows the savings rate has gone down over time, which is not evident with `geom_path()`.

```{python}
(
    ggplot(economics, aes(x="unemploy/pop", y="psavert"))
    + geom_path(
        colour="#ff69b4",  # plot geom_path as the first layer - colour pink
        alpha=0.5,  # line transparency
        size=2.5,
    )  # line thickness
    + geom_line()  # layer geom_line
    + labs(x="scaled unemployment", y="saving rate")  # label x & y-axis
)
```

The `geom_path` can be easier to interpret if time is coloured in. First convert time to a number, and use this number to colour the path:

```{python}
# convert date to a number
economics["date_as_number"] = pd.to_numeric(economics["date"])
```

```{python}
# inspect new column
economics.head()
```

The path is coloured such that it changes with time using the command `aes(colour='date_as_number')` within `geom_path()`.

```{python}
# input
legend_breaks = [
    -79056000000000000,
    709948800000000000,
    1401580800000000000,
]  # used to modify colour-graded legend
legend_labels = ["1967-Jul", "1992-Jun", "2014-Jun"]

# plot
(
    ggplot(economics, aes(x="unemploy/pop", y="psavert"))
    + geom_path(
        aes(colour="date_as_number")
    )  # colour geom_path using time variable "date_as_number"
    + labs(x="scaled unemployment", y="saving rate")
    + scale_color_continuous(
        breaks=legend_breaks,  # set legend breaks (where labels will appear)
        labels=legend_labels,
    )  # set labels on legend
    + theme(legend_title=element_text(text="Date"))  # set title of legend
)
```
